##  Dataset

Built on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

- Includes features like mean, SE, and worst for attributes such as radius, texture, area, smoothness, and more.
- Original data contains columns like `id`, `Unnamed: 32`, which are removed during preprocessing.
- Labels are mapped as:
  - `M → 1` (Malignant)
  - `B → 0` (Benign)
